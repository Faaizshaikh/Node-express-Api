## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

This project features an advanced GitHub Actions workflow with:

### 🔧 Matrix Testing
- Tests across Node.js versions: **16.x, 18.x, 20.x**
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Comprehensive test results stored in `test-results/` directory

### ⚡ Conditional Builds
- Builds only run after all matrix tests pass
- Triggered on:
  - ✅ Push to `main` branch
  - ✅ Version tags matching `v*.*.*` pattern
- Build artifacts stored in `dist/` directory

### 🎯 Advanced Features
- Manual approval before publishing artifacts
- Cancels superseded runs on the same branch
- Artifact collection for test results and build outputs

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Faaizshaikh/Node-express-Api.git
cd node-express-api
```

2. Install dependencies:
